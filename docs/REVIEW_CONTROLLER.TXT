üìã COMPREHENSIVE CONTROLLER AUDIT REPORT
Based on my thorough analysis of all controllers in your Laravel application, here are the findings:
üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES: Duplicate Controllers
1. CloudBackupController (3 DUPLICATES!)
There are THREE versions of the CloudBackupController:
Location	Lines	Status	Used In Routes?
app/Http/Controllers/CloudBackupController.php	~15 lines	‚ùå LEGACY/UNUSED	‚ùå No routes
app/Http/Controllers/Midwife/CloudBackupController.php	~453 lines	‚úÖ ACTIVE	‚ùå NOT USED (imported but no routes)
app/Http/Controllers/Admin/CloudBackupController.php	~544 lines	‚úÖ ACTIVE	‚úÖ USED (lines 231-241 in routes)
Analysis:
Base CloudBackupController (root): Only returns a view, very minimal, appears to be legacy code
Midwife CloudBackupController: Full-featured but NOT actually used in routes despite being imported in web.php (line 13)
Admin CloudBackupController: Full-featured and ACTIVELY used in admin routes with prefix admin.cloudbackup.*
Recommendation:
‚úÖ KEEP: app/Http/Controllers/Admin/CloudBackupController.php (in use)
‚ùå DELETE: app/Http/Controllers/CloudBackupController.php (legacy/minimal)
‚ö†Ô∏è  REVIEW: app/Http/Controllers/Midwife/CloudBackupController.php (imported but unused in routes)
üü° UNUSED/LEGACY CONTROLLERS
2. ChildImmunizationController
Property	Value
Path	app/Http/Controllers/ChildImmunizationController.php
Status	‚ö†Ô∏è LEGACY - Still referenced in routes but uses deprecated model
Routes	Lines 115-117 (midwife), 199-201 (bhw)
Model Used	ChildImmunization (empty table, 0 records)
Replacement	ImmunizationController with Immunization model (190 records)
Evidence:
Routes still exist in web.php
Uses ChildImmunization model which has 0 database records
ImmunizationController is the active controller with 190 records in database
Recommendation:
‚ùå DELETE: ChildImmunizationController.php
‚ùå DELETE: Model ChildImmunization.php
‚ùå REMOVE: Routes in web.php (lines 115-117, 199-201)
‚ùå DROP TABLE: child_immunizations
‚ö†Ô∏è MISSING/REFERENCED BUT NON-EXISTENT
3. PrenatalController
Property	Value
Path	‚ùå DOES NOT EXIST
Referenced In	routes/web.php:6
Status	üêõ IMPORT ERROR
Actual Controller	PrenatalRecordController (exists and is used)
Recommendation:
‚ùå REMOVE: Line 6 in routes/web.php
   - Change: use App\Http\Controllers\PrenatalController;
   - This import is not needed and references a non-existent controller
‚úÖ ACTIVE AND PROPERLY USED CONTROLLERS
These controllers are properly implemented and actively used:
‚úÖ AuthController - Authentication (login/logout)
‚úÖ PrenatalRecordController - Prenatal records management
‚úÖ PrenatalCheckupController - Prenatal checkup scheduling
‚úÖ ChildRecordController - Child records management
‚úÖ ImmunizationController - Immunization scheduling (ACTIVE, 190 records)
‚úÖ UserController - User management
‚úÖ PatientController - Patient management
‚úÖ VaccineController - Vaccine inventory management
‚úÖ DashboardController - Dashboard views
‚úÖ GoogleAuthController - Google OAuth integration
‚úÖ NotificationController - Notification system
‚úÖ ReportController - Report generation
‚úÖ AppointmentController - Appointment management
‚úÖ SystemAnalysisController - System analysis reports
‚úÖ AdminController - Admin dashboard and management
‚úÖ Admin\CloudBackupController - Cloud backup (Admin access)
üìä SUMMARY STATISTICS
Category	Count
Total Controllers Found	20 files
Active & Used	16 controllers
Duplicate Issues	3 CloudBackupController versions
Legacy/Unused	1 ChildImmunizationController
Import Errors	1 PrenatalController
Recommended for Deletion	3 files + routes
üéØ RECOMMENDED CLEANUP ACTIONS
Priority 1: Remove Duplicates
# Delete unused CloudBackupController
del "app\Http\Controllers\CloudBackupController.php"

# Review if Midwife needs cloud backup access
# If yes, add routes; if no, delete:
# del "app\Http\Controllers\Midwife\CloudBackupController.php"
Priority 2: Remove Legacy Immunization Controller
# Delete legacy controller
del "app\Http\Controllers\ChildImmunizationController.php"

# Delete legacy model
del "app\Models\ChildImmunization.php"

# Remove routes from web.php (lines 115-117, 199-201)
# Drop database table: child_immunizations
Priority 3: Fix Import Error
// In routes/web.php
// Remove line 6:
- use App\Http\Controllers\PrenatalController;
